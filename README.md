# cs585-poker-bot
Final Project for CS585. An IVC program that plays poker with physical cards by reading card values for the best next action.
This program plays games of poker with a user. There are dedicated boxes for which the player has to place his chips, cards, and community pots in. The bot will process the information and prompt the user for a card to read and process. Then, it will make the best decision possible considering the card value, the board, and the chips.

Requires a webcam to play.
